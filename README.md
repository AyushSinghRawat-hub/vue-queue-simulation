# Queue Simulation with Vue.js

This project demonstrates a **queue simulation** using **Vue.js** to visualize enqueue, dequeue, peek, and other queue operations. The queue items are represented as dice, which are added or removed from the queue. The user can interact with the queue using buttons that perform various operations.

## Features

- **Enqueue Operation**: Add a new item (die) to the queue.
- **Dequeue Operation**: Remove the front item from the queue.
- **Peek Operation**: View the first item in the queue without removing it.
- **Size**: Display the current number of items in the queue.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for enqueue and dequeue actions, with visual feedback on each item.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework used to build the interactive UI.
- **HTML/CSS**: To structure and style the page.
- **JavaScript**: For managing the logic behind the queue operations.
